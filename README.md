### Basic of Python 

![](/images/Py.png)

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system with reference counting.

Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.

The Python 2 language was officially discontinued in 2020 (first planned for 2015), and "Python 2.7.18 is the last Python 2.7 release and therefore the last Python 2 release."[30] No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it.With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.5. and later are supported.

Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. A global community of programmers develops and maintains CPython, an open source reference implementation. A non-profit organization, the Python Software Foundation, manages and directs resources for Python and CPython development.

### Working on List , Loops.
#### About List

A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements. Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item. Just as strings are defined as characters between quotes, lists are defined by having values between square brackets [ ].

Lists are great to use when you want to work with many related values. They enable you to keep data together that belongs together, condense your code, and perform the same methods and operations on multiple values at once.

When thinking about Python lists and other data structures that are types of collections, it is useful to consider all the different collections you have on your computer: your assortment of files, your song playlists, your browser bookmarks, your emails, the collection of videos you can access on a streaming service, and more.

#### About Loops
In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times.

Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.

A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. The following diagram illustrates a loop statement −

#### Types Of loop in python:
#### 1. While Loop
A while loop statement in Python programming language repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.

          Syntax
          The syntax of a while loop in Python programming language is −
          while expression:
          statement(s)
                 
          Here, statement(s) may be a single statement or a block of statements. The condition may be any expression, and true is any non-zero value. 
          The loop iterates while the condition is true.
          When the condition becomes false, program control passes to the line immediately following the loop.
          In Python, all the statements indented by the same number of character spaces after a programming construct are considered to be part of 
          a single block of code. Python uses indentation as its method of grouping statements.

#### 2. For Loop
It has the ability to iterate over the items of any sequence, such as a list or a string.

            Syntax
           for iterating_var in sequence:
           statements(s)
           If a sequence contains an expression list, it is evaluated first. Then, the first item in the sequence is assigned to the iterating variable iterating_var. 
           Next, the statements block is executed. Each item in the list is assigned to iterating_var, and the statement(s) block is executed until the entire
           sequence is exhausted.
#### 3.Decision Making 

Decision making is anticipation of conditions occurring while execution of the program and specifying actions taken according to the conditions.

Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions which produce TRUE or FALSE as outcome. You need to determine which action to take and which statements to execute 
if outcome is TRUE or FALSE otherwise.

Example: If Else statement

### Working on Function ,Object Oriented Programming ,Exception Handling.

#### About Function 

A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation and produces output. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done task together and make a function, so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function.
Python provides built-in functions like print(), etc. but we can also create your own functions. These functions are called user-defined functions.

#### About Object Oriented Programming 

Object-oriented Programming, or OOP for short, is a programming paradigm which provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.
For instance, an object could represent a person with a name property, age, address, etc., with behaviors like walking, talking, breathing, and running. Or an email with properties like recipient list, subject, body, etc., and behaviors like adding attachments and sending.
Put another way, object-oriented programming is an approach for modeling concrete, real-world things like cars as well as relations between things like companies and employees, students and teachers, etc. OOP models real-world entities as software objects, which have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions.
Another common programming paradigm is procedural programming which structures a program like a recipe in that it provides a set of steps, in the form of functions and code blocks, which flow sequentially in order to complete a task.
The key takeaway is that objects are at the center of the object-oriented programming paradigm, not only representing the data, as in procedural programming, but in the overall structure of the program as well.

#### About Exception Handling

Error in Python can be of two types i.e. Syntax errors and Exceptions. Errors are the problems in a program due to which the program will stop the execution. On the other hand, exceptions are raised when some internal events occur which changes the normal flow of the program.

### Working Started With Numpy 

NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.

It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains various features including these important ones:
<ul>
          <li>A powerful N-dimensional array object</li>
<li>Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions</li>
<li>Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code</li>
<li>Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities</li>
<li>Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data.</li>
<li>Arbitrary data-types can be defined using Numpy which allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.</li>
          </ul>
