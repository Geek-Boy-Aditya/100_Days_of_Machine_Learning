# Normalization vs. Standardization : 

![](Feature-image-Normalization.png)

I’m sure most of you must have faced this issue in your projects or your learning journey. For example, one feature is entirely in kilograms while the other is in grams, another one is liters, and so on. How can we use these features when they vary so vastly in terms of what they’re presenting?

Here’s the curious thing about feature scaling – it improves (significantly) the performance of some machine learning algorithms and does not work at all for others. What could be the reason behind this quirk?

Also, what’s the difference between normalization and standardization? These are two of the most commonly used feature scaling techniques in machine learning but a level of ambiguity exists in their understanding. When should you use which technique?
